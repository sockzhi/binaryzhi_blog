# differences between CPU and GPU

| CPU                                                          | GPU                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Really fast caches (great for data reuse)                    | Lots of math units                                           |
| Fine branching granularity                                   | Fast access to onboard memory                                |
| Lots of different processes/threads                          | Run a program on each fragment/vertex                        |
| High performance on a single thread of execution             | High throughput on parallel tasks                            |
| CPUs are great for task parallelism                          | GPUs are great for data parallelism                          |
| CPU optimised for high performance on sequential codes (caches and branch prediction) | GPU optimised for higher arithmetic intensity for parallel nature (Floating point operations) |
